## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Extension doesn't work on certain pages (e.g., New Tab page)</b></summary>
  
**Cause:** For security reasons, Chrome extensions are not allowed to run on internal `chrome://` pages (like Settings, Bookmarks, or the Extensions page itself), the Chrome Web Store, or other protected browser pages.

**Solution:** This is expected behavior. The extension will function correctly on standard websites.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Keyboard shortcuts are not working</b></summary>
  
**Cause:** Another extension might be using the same shortcuts, or the shortcuts might have been changed.

**Solution:**
1.  Navigate to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`.
2.  Find "Area Links" in the list.
3.  Check for any conflicts and reassign the shortcuts if needed.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>No links are opening even after I make a selection</b></summary>
  
**Cause:** The links might be filtered out by your settings, or the selection area might not contain valid links.

**Solution:**
1.  Ensure your selection box covers actual, clickable `<a>` links.
2.  Check your **Options Page** to see if the links are being blocked by your **Excluded Domains** or **Excluded Words** filters.
3.  If you have "Remember opened links" enabled, try clearing the history via the Options Page or popup.
4.  Verify that links are visible (not hidden with CSS) and have non-zero dimensions.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Selection box doesn't appear or behaves unexpectedly</b></summary>
  
**Cause:** The content script may not have loaded properly on the page.

**Solution:**
1. Try refreshing the page.
2. If the issue persists, the extension will automatically inject scripts when you use the shortcut or context menu.
3. Check if any other extensions might be interfering with page scripts.
4. Verify that the page URL starts with `http://` or `https://`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Performance issues on pages with many links</b></summary>
  
**Cause:** Pages with thousands of links may experience slower performance during selection.

**Solution:**
1. The extension uses IntersectionObserver to optimize performance by only tracking visible links.
2. On extremely large pages, consider selecting smaller areas.
3. Close unnecessary tabs to free up browser resources.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Clipboard copy operation fails</b></summary>
  
**Cause:** Modern browsers require secure contexts (HTTPS) for clipboard access, or permissions may be denied.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you're on an HTTPS page (the extension includes a fallback for HTTP pages).
2. If you see a permission error, allow clipboard access in your browser settings.
3. The extension uses a fallback mechanism with `document.execCommand('copy')` for compatibility.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations
- **IntersectionObserver API**: Efficiently tracks only visible links on the page with a 200px margin, reducing memory usage on large pages.
- **RequestAnimationFrame**: Smooth selection box rendering and link highlighting updates for optimal 60fps performance.
- **Settings Cache**: Session storage cache minimizes repeated storage API calls and improves response time.
- **Lazy Script Injection**: Content scripts are injected on-demand only when needed, reducing initial load impact.
- **Efficient Link Caching**: Pre-calculates bounding rectangles during mousedown to avoid layout thrashing during selection.
- **Smart Updates**: Debounced update scheduling prevents excessive DOM operations during mouse movement.

### Browser Compatibility
- Built with **Manifest V3** for modern Chrome extensions
- Requires Chrome/Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)
- Minimum Chrome version: 88+
- Fully compatible with the latest Chrome security requirements

### Smart Behaviors
- **Automatic Tab Switching Prevention**: Automatically resets selection when switching to a different tab
- **Link Validation**: Filters out invalid links (anchors, javascript:, hidden elements, zero-size elements)
- **Duplicate Detection**: Multiple mechanisms to prevent duplicate link opening/copying
- **Context Awareness**: Different cursor styles and behaviors for open vs. copy modes
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback clipboard copy method for non-secure contexts
